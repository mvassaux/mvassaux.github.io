### Computational investigation of the emergence of complexity in matter

Over the few research projects I had, the best couple of words I could use to describe my activities are probably "computational material scientist". I consistently use a computational modelling approach, based on mechanics of materials at different scales, to understand how certain properties or mechanisms emerge. Application of such technique led me to study a wide spectrum of systems, from stability of concrete under seismic loading, to migration of mesenchymal stem cells, and currently, failure of polymers.


### Hysteresis and scale effects in concrete

### Topography induced migration of mesenchymal stem cells

### Hierarchical fracture properties of polymer nanocomposites
