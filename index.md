Over the few research projects I had, the best couple of words I could use to describe my activities are probably "computational material scientist". I consistently use a computational modelling approach, based on mechanics of materials at different scales, to understand how certain properties or mechanisms emerge. Application of such technique led me to study a wide spectrum of systems, from stability of concrete under seismic loading, to migration of mesenchymal stem cells, and currently, failure of polymers.

** figure: systems modelled on a space vs. time graph **
- clicking on each part of the graph should point to the detailed description of each project
- the graph should also contain the different softwares I used or developed

I should tell you here shortly what I have studied during each of these projects: Hysteresis and scale effects in concrete, topography induced migration of mesenchymal stem cells, hierarchical fracture properties of polymer nanocomposites; and how it led me to the design of my own project.

And of course, here I should tell you what this project is about.

** should I do a single or multiple page structure? **
