Over the few research projects I had, the best couple of words I could use to describe my activities are probably "computational material scientist". I consistently use a computational modelling approach, based on mechanics of materials at different scales, to understand how certain properties or mechanisms emerge. Application of such technique led me to study a wide spectrum of systems, from stability of concrete under seismic loading, to migration of mesenchymal stem cells, and currently, failure of polymer nanocomposites.

<!-- ** figure: systems modelled on a space vs. time graph **
- clicking on each part of the graph should point to the detailed description of each project
- the graph should also contain the different softwares I used or developed -->

I should tell now you what this project is about...

<!-- ** should I do a single or multiple page structure? ** -->
